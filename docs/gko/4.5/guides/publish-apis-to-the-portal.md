# Publish APIs to the portal

Whether or not APIs managed by GKO are published to the Gravitee Developer Portal is a controlled by an attribute called **lifecycle\_state** that is common to both `ApiV4Definition` and `ApiDefinition` CRDs.

The CRDs are also used to determine which [categories](publish-apis-to-the-portal.md#setting-a-category-for-an-api) an API should belong to, and can be used to facilitate navigate through large numbers of APIs on the developer portal.

## Publish an API to the portal

By default, APIs are not published to the developer portal. To publish an API, set the `lifecycle_state` property value to `PUBLISHED`:

```yaml
apiVersion: gravitee.io/v1alpha1
kind: ApiDefinition
metadata:
  name: basic-api-example
  namespace: gravitee
spec:
  name: gko-example
  contextRef: 
    name: "management-context-1"
  version: 1.0.0
  description: Basic api managed by Gravitee Kubernetes Operator
  lifecycle_state: PUBLISHED
  local: false
  proxy:
    virtual_hosts:
      - path: /k8s-basic
    groups:
      - endpoints:
          - name: Default
            target: https://api.gravitee.io/echo
```

To unpublish the API, change the `lifecycle_state` property value to `UNPUBLISHED`.

## Setting a category for an API

APIs can be grouped into categories to improve navigation for API consumers that discover APIs on the developer portal. Both `ApiV4Definition` and `ApiDefinition` can reference categories in APIM by name. If a category is referenced that does not exist in APIM, it will simply be ignored.&#x20;

Below is an example `ApiV4Definition` that references two categories called `banking` and `credit`:

```yaml
apiVersion: gravitee.io/v1alpha1
kind: ApiV4Definition
metadata:
  name: api-v4
  namespace: gravitee
spec:
  name: api-v4
  contextRef: 
    name: "management-context-1"
  definitionContext:
    origin: KUBERNETES
    syncFrom: MANAGEMENT

  type: PROXY
  categories: 
    - banking
    - credit
  listeners:
    - type: HTTP
      paths:
        - path: "/echo-v4"
      entrypoints:
        - type: http-proxy
          qos: AUTO
  endpointGroups:
    - name: Default HTTP proxy group
      type: http-proxy
      endpoints:
        - name: Default HTTP proxy
          type: http-proxy
          inheritConfiguration: false
          configuration:
            target: https://api.gravitee.io/echo
          secondary: false
  flowExecution:
    mode: DEFAULT
    matchRequired: false
  plans:
    KeyLess:
      name: Free plan

```
