## New version of the LDAP Identity Provider

With the new version of the LDAP identity provider, you can access the Operational Attributes linked to the user profile coming from the LDAP server.

{% hint style="info" %}
Operational attributes are available for User mappers and are not added to user profile explicitly.
{% endhint %}

To retrieve all operational attributes,  set `+` as a value into the configuration form. To retrieve only the ones you are interested in, add the names you are expecting separated using a coma. For example, createTimestamp,modifyTimestamp.

## User Migration

For users migrations from an alternative OIDC provider to Access Management, you can define the `lastPasswordReset` attribute. This attribute ensures that a password policy with password expiry requests a password reset according to the value provided during the migration. This attribute is accepted only during user creation through the SCIM protocol or the Management API.

{% hint style="warning" %}
In Management REST API, `lastPasswordReset` attribute is a long value.

In SCIM request, `lastPasswordReset` attribute is expected to be a String using ISO-8601 representation to be align with other date attributes defined by the SCIM specification. As it is a specific information, the Gravitee schema extension `"urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:custom:2.0:User"` has to be used.
{% endhint %}

## Audit Logs

Additional audit logs have been added on the SCIM endpoint to track failing user creations or updates due to an invalid password. In addition to this update, a distinction is made between user login with password and using passwordless. The dashboard now shows both of these login types.

## Bulk action for user provisioning

User provisioning is now possible using Bulk actions to create, update or delete users. A dedicated endpoint has been added on the Management API and the SCIM protocol exposed by the Gateway implement the Bulk endpoint.

{% hint style="warning" %}
SCIM Bulk action for Groups is not implemented.
{% endhint %}

## New Certificate plugin
