# Geography and provider support

Gravitee Cloud allows allows you to choose where your API Management control plane will be hosted, as well as where your Gravitee hosted API gateways will run.\
\
This is important to ensure ensure your compliance requirements for data privacy, but as important when it comes to latency to ensure your Gravitee hosted API Gateway runs close to your end users and your upstream services published in the gateway.\
