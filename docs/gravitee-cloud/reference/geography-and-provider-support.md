# Geography and Provider Support

Gravitee Cloud allows you to choose where your API Management control plane is hosted, as well as where your Gravitee-hosted API Gateways run.

This is important to ensure compliance with data privacy requirements, and also to minimize latency, as it guarantees your Gravitee-hosted API Gateway runs close to your end users and upstream services.

Gravitee Cloud currently offers the following geography and provider support. If youâ€™re interested in another geography or provider, Gravitee can introduce that for you.
